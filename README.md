# mnist-demo

The purpose of this project is to manually test different classifiers on MNIST. My [mnist package](https://github.com/unixpickle/mnist) already facilitates the training and testing of classifiers on MNIST, but it is not interactive. This project serves to augment that package with interactive demos.
